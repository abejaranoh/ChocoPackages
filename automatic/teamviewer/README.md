## Notes

- The vendor does not update the version number but will update the software from time to time rendering the checksum invalid. If this happens then you can use the `--ignore-checksums` switch or wait until the new version is released.
- This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a week, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
