## Choco Cleaner RT for lib-bad deletes the Chocolatey lib-bad folder which contains Chocolatey packages that failed to install

**Choco Cleaner RT** (runtime/realtime - you choose) hooks are the natural evolution of my [Choco-Cleaner](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner) script using hooks available in Chocolatey v1.2.0+. These hooks do micro cleansing by duplicating the features of **Choco Cleaner** before and after package installs, thus RT. No scheduling. No manually running anything. No need to edit a config file. Just install the choco-cleaner-rt-XXX.hook(s) you want. **Choco Cleaner RT** hooks run WHEN you install and update packages.

### NOTES:
* Recovered disk space will not be as dramatic as when running **Choco-Cleaner** since **Choco-Cleaner-RT** will be running far more often and you'll see smaller results on a per package basis.
* Some **Choco-Cleaner-RT** micro cleansing happens on previously installed packages instead of the current one due to technical restrictions; i.e. **choco-cleaner-rt-ignores.hook** can not delete .ignore files from the current package or Chocolatey will make shims for everything the packager didn't want shimmed.
* File deletion logging and toggling the displayed info off are possible via a config, see [choco-cleaner-rt](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner-rt) for more info.
* A few features of **Choco-Cleaner** are not going to be supported by CCRT such as orphaned shim checking and deleting of Chocolatey .log and .old files; if you want these features please use [Choco-Cleaner](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/choco-cleaner).
